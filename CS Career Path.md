Here‚Äôs a **mobile-first, time-conscious roadmap for Computer Science (CS)** tailored to your constraints (Android-only access, labor job, no prior knowledge, and no budget). This plan focuses on foundational CS concepts, practical coding skills, and career transition strategies that work around your schedule:

---

### **1. Start with CS Fundamentals (1‚Äì3 Months)**  
**Goal**: Build a conceptual foundation with minimal screen time.  
- **Podcasts/Audiobooks** (listen during breaks/commute):  
  - *"But How Do It Know?"* (audiobook on how computers work).  
  - *CodeNewbie Podcast* (stories from self-taught developers).  
- **YouTube Shorts/Reels**:  
  - Follow channels like @Fireship (bite-sized CS explainers) or @TechWithTim (Python basics).  
- **Free Apps for Logic**:  
  - **Mimo** (gamified coding basics).  
  - **Brilliant.org** (free logic/math puzzles; cancel before trial ends).  

---

### **2. Learn Programming Basics (3‚Äì6 Months)**  
**Focus**: Python (easiest for mobile coding) + problem-solving.  
- **Mobile Coding Tools**:  
  - **Sololearn**: Free Python/Java/HTML courses with a mobile code editor.  
  - **Pydroid 3**: Offline Python IDE for Android (practice loops, functions, etc.).  
  - **Termux**: Turn your Android into a Linux terminal (advanced; [tutorial](https://termux.com/)).  
- **Math Basics**:  
  - **Khan Academy App**: Discrete math, algebra, and logic in 10-minute sessions.  
- **Practice**:  
  - Solve 1 coding problem/day on **Codewars** (mobile browser-friendly).  

---

### **3. Core CS Concepts (6‚Äì12 Months)**  
**Learn key topics** (algorithms, data structures, OS basics):  
- **Free Mobile-Friendly Courses**:  
  - **CS50‚Äôs Mobile Ed** (Harvard‚Äôs intro to CS on edX; watch lectures via YouTube).  
  - **Google‚Äôs Python Class** (text-based tutorials; works on mobile browsers).  
- **Interactive Apps**:  
  - **Enki** (daily 5-minute CS drills: algorithms, Git, SQL).  
  - **Programming Hub** (offers data structures tutorials).  
- **Projects**:  
  - Build a text-based game in Python.  
  - Automate a personal task (e.g., SMS reminders via Termux + Python).  

---

### **4. Networking & Community (Ongoing)**  
- **Reddit**: Join r/learnprogramming or r/cs50 (mobile-friendly).  
- **Discord**: Servers like *The Programming Zone* or *CS50‚Äôs official server* for support.  
- **LinkedIn Lite**: Follow CS educators (e.g., David Malan, CS50‚Äôs instructor).  

---

### **5. Specialize & Apply Skills (12‚Äì18 Months)**  
**Leverage your plant job experience**:  
- **Domain-Specific Skills**:  
  - Study CS applications in manufacturing (e.g., IoT, PLC programming).  
  - Propose efficiency tools (e.g., a Python script to track work logs).  
- **Freelancing**:  
  - Start with basic gigs:  
    - Fix broken websites (HTML/CSS) via **Upwork/Fiverr**.  
    - Build simple Android apps with **MIT App Inventor** (no coding).  
- **Certifications**:  
  - **Google IT Support Certificate** (Coursera; apply for financial aid).  
  - **FreeCodeCamp‚Äôs Responsive Design** (mobile-friendly curriculum).  

---

### **6. Time Management Hacks**  
- **Micro-Learning**:  
  - Practice coding during lunch (15 mins on Sololearn).  
  - Listen to CS lectures while commuting.  
- **Voice Notes**:  
  - Explain concepts aloud (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a linked list?‚Äù) to reinforce learning.  
- **Weekend Sprints**:  
  - Dedicate 2‚Äì3 hours to projects (e.g., build a calculator app in Python).  

---

### **Mobile Toolbox**  
- **Coding**: Sololearn, Pydroid 3, Termux.  
- **Theory**: Khan Academy, YouTube, Enki.  
- **Projects**: GitHub Mobile (host code), Google Docs (write pseudocode).  
- **Community**: Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn Lite.  

---

### **Transition Strategies**  
1. **Upskill in Your Job**:  
   - Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., generate work reports with Python).  
   - Volunteer to help with IT/software tools at your plant.  
2. **Entry-Level Roles**:  
   - Target jobs like **IT Support**, **Junior Web Developer**, or **QA Tester**.  
   - Highlight problem-solving skills from your labor job (e.g., troubleshooting machinery ‚Üí debugging code).  
3. **Freelance Portfolio**:  
   - Create mobile-friendly projects (e.g., a Python script that sorts work schedules).  

---

### **Mindset Tips**  
- **Start Small**: Even 10 minutes/day adds up.  
- **Embrace Constraints**: Coding on a phone is hard, but it builds grit (a key CS skill!).  
- **Offline Work**: Download PDFs (e.g., *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*) for offline study.  

---

### **Sample Timeline**  
- **Month 1‚Äì3**: Audiobooks + logic puzzles.  
- **Month 4‚Äì6**: Python basics + Codewars.  
- **Month 7‚Äì9**: CS50 lectures + data structures.  
- **Month 10‚Äì12**: Build 2‚Äì3 small projects.  
- **Month 13+**: Apply for IT roles or freelance.

### **Final Note**  
Your hands-on work ethic and problem-solving skills from labor are **huge assets** in CS. Many developers lack your practical grit. Stay consistent, and in 1‚Äì2 years, you‚Äôll have a solid foundation to pivot into tech. üíª
