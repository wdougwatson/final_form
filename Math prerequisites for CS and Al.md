Okay, let's combine the math prerequisites for AI certification and basic programming/CS, and then find free resources that work well on an Android phone.
Combined Math Prerequisites:
 * Basic Arithmetic: Essential for all programming tasks.
 * Algebra: Crucial for variables, equations, and functions.
 * Discrete Mathematics:
   * Logic (Boolean algebra)
   * Set Theory
   * Combinatorics
   * Graph Theory
 * Linear Algebra: Fundamental for AI/ML.
   * vectors, matricies, tensors.
 * Calculus: Essential for AI/ML optimization.
   * derivatives, gradients.
 * Probability and Statistics: Vital for data analysis in AI/ML.
 * Binary Mathematics: Understanding how computers represent data.
Free Android-Friendly Resources:
 * Khan Academy (App & Website):
   * This is an excellent resource for learning all the math topics listed above.
   * The Khan Academy app works great on Android, with video lessons, practice exercises, and progress tracking.
   * It covers arithmetic, algebra, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.
   * It is great for learning at your own pace.
 * Brilliant (App & Website):
   * Brilliant focuses on interactive problem-solving and conceptual understanding.
   * It's particularly strong in logic, algebra, and discrete mathematics.
   * While there is a paid option, there are free daily problems that are very useful.
   * The android app is very well designed.
 * Symbolab (App & Website):
   * Symbolab is a powerful calculator and problem solver that covers algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and more.
   * It's helpful for checking your work and understanding step-by-step solutions.
   * This is a great tool for when you get stuck on a math problem.
 * Mathway (App & Website):
   * Similar to Symbolab, Mathway provides step-by-step solutions to a wide range of math problems.
   * This is another very good tool for checking your math work.
 * Programming Hub (App):
   * While not strictly math, Programming Hub offers courses on various programming languages and CS concepts.
   * It can help you apply your mathematical knowledge in practical programming scenarios.
   * This app is very good for learning the basics of many programming languages.
 * SoloLearn (App):
   * Simular to programming hub, SoloLearn offers free courses on many programming languages.
   * It also has a very good community.
 * Google Play Books:
   * You can find many free or low-cost ebooks on mathematics and computer science.
   * Search for "free mathematics ebooks" or "free computer science ebooks."
   * This is a good way to read textbooks on your android device.
Tips for Android Learning:
 * Use a stylus (if possible): For taking notes and working through math problems, a stylus can be helpful.
 * Take advantage of offline features: Many of these apps allow you to download content for offline viewing, which is useful when you don't have internet access.
 * Break down learning into small chunks: Don't try to cram too much information at once. Short, regular study sessions are more effective.
 * Practice regularly: Math and programming require consistent practice.
 * Join online communities: Engage in online forums or communities where you can ask questions and learn from others.
I hope this helps you on your learning journey!
